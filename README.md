# indepth-driving-data-analysis
I received my black box data and it has information about the speed, location and time of my driving. and I also have a medium score for my driving (due to driving at night). in this project I will attempt to understand my driving patterns and see what Data analysis and Machine learning skills I can gain as I do so.
